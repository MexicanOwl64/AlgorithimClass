The program will allow a person to add the names all of the items that they own and categorize them how they want to.  This will help if some games don't have a rarity system or if you believe a piece of equipment should be a different rarity and so you don't lose it. 

At the moment only text will be implement to make sure that the program is working and once the tesing the text is over other things will be added to make the program work.  
To use the program make sure you know the name of the objects that you want to add to type it in and make your own list.
